# Cloud-lab
On first section of the course, we learned about the cloud and its services. We also learned about the different types of cloud computing, including public, private, and hybrid clouds. We also learned about the differences between Capex and Opex.

## Concepts
1. **Cloud Computing**: The delivery of computing services over the internet, including storage, processing power, and software applications. Allows users to access and use resources on-demand without the need for physical infrastructure, enabling scalability, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness.
2. **Public Cloud**: A cloud computing model where services are provided over the internet and shared among multiple users. Public clouds are owned and operated by third-party providers, offering resources on a pay-as-you-go basis.
3. **Private Cloud**: A cloud computing model where services are dedicated to a single organization. Private clouds can be hosted on-premises or by a third-party provider, offering greater control, security, and customization compared to public clouds.
4. **Hybrid Cloud**: A cloud computing model that combines public and private clouds, allowing organizations to leverage the benefits of both. Hybrid clouds enable data and applications to be shared between environments, providing flexibility and scalability.
5. **Capex (Capital Expenditure)**: The upfront costs associated with purchasing and maintaining physical infrastructure, such as servers, storage, and networking equipment. Capex is typically a one-time expense and is recorded as an asset on the balance sheet. Example: buying a server.
6. **Opex (Operational Expenditure)**: The ongoing costs associated with running and maintaining IT services, such as cloud subscriptions, software licenses, and support services. Opex is typically a recurring expense and is recorded as an expense on the income statement. Example: paying for a cloud service subscription.
